## Emails

One of the simplest ways to contribute to SRC is by sharing recruiting emails. At SRC, we want to build the best recruiting experience for candidates. We want to automate away all the parts of the recruiting process that isn't essential to the qualification process.

To do this, we are collecting recruiting emails to train our models on. If SRC misses a recruiting email or labels an email incorrectly, help us improve by forwarding the email to [examples@sharedrecruiting.co](mailto:examples@sharedrecruiting.co).
