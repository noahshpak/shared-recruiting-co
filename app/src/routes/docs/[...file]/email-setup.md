# {% $frontmatter.title %}

SRC manages your inbound job opportunities for you by connecting to your email account. If you've already created a SRC account, you've already been through this process.

You only need to connect an account once to install SRC. If SRC loses a connection, you'll receive an email to re-connect it. Once re-activated, SRC will sync your inbox back to the last time your email was active.

You can also pause SRC at any time by clicking the `Deactivate` button it in your account settings.
