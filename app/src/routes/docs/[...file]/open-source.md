# Open Source

## Why is SRC Open Source?

###  Trust 
In the tech world today, trust isn't cheap. Privacy scandal after privacy scandal has left scars on consumers. We believe great companies are built on trust and members of SRC trust us with some of their most sensitive information, their emails and job status. Open sourcing SRC solidifies our commitment to trust, transparency, and privacy and keeps us accountable to our end users.

### Empower Candidates

Disdain for the current recruiting paradigm is palpable throughout the internet. There are even [subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/) dedicated to it. Yet there is no clear way for candidates to take control of their experience.

By open sourcing SRC, we want to empower candidates to create change and have a voice in their experience. For some, that might mean building an integration to make interview scheduling effortless. For others, it could mean starting a discussion on how to disincentivize recruiters from ghosting candidates.

### Candidates > Code

At the end of the day, SRC's success depends on creating significant, differentiate value for candidates. Code is a means to create that value, but the value will come from candidates themselves. Open sourcing our code forces us to compete on the value we create value for candidates rather than a technical edge, like many "AI" companies.

### Give Back

Ever wonder how to parse an email body from the Gmail API? Want to know how to forward a message programmatically with the same formatting as your email client? How about how to built documentation site with Svelte and Markdoc ðŸ˜‰?

While building SRC, we are going to solve many of the same technical problems that others face. Open sourcing our code is another way to give back to the community, share our learnings, and hopefully save some folks a few headaches.

## Can I Contribute?

Yes! There are many ways to contribute to SRC beyond code. Read more in the [contributing section](/docs/contributing#contributing).

## Is Any Part of SRC Closed Source?

Yes, the only closed sourced part of SRC is our classification model. At the moment, we believe it's more valuable to candidates to keep the model closed source and make it more difficult for  companies to bypass the model than to make the model open source.  Our hope is to open source this in the future, so will continue to revisit this assumption as we grow!
