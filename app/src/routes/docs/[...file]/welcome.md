{% $frontmatter.description %}

The Shared Recruiting Co., or SRC (pronounced "source"), is an open source, candidate-centric recruiting platform that promotes two-way opt-in communication between candidates and companies.

For candidates, SRC keeps your inbox distraction free when you aren't looking for a role and supercharges your search once you are. 

For companies, SRCÂ stops you from wasting time sourcing candidates that aren't actively looking for a new role. SRC integrates into your existing recruiting stack and automatically re-engages _interested_ candidates once they are ready for a new role.

{% callout title="Invite Only" type="note" %}
SRC is currently invite only. If you know SRC member, have them refer you.


If not, [join the waitlist](/join). You'll receive an email once you can create an account!

## "Candidates"
At SRC, we use the term candidate loosely. The rise in direct outbound recruiting has blurred the definition of a candidate. Companies reach out to individuals whether or not they are looking for a job, so we use the same definition at SRC.
A candidate is both active and prospective candidate. If you are ever looking for a new job, you are a candidate!
