## Auto-Contribute Recruiting Emails

At SRC, we want to build the best recruiting experience for candidates. We want to automate away all the parts of the recruiting process that isn't essential to the qualification process.

To do this, we are collecting examples of recruiting emails to train our models on. When this settings is enabled, all recruiting emails you receive will be added to the recruiting email dataset. These emails will exclusively used for improving SRC and will not be shared with anyone.

You can always contribute emails manually by forwarding them to [examples@sharedrecruitng.co](mailto:examples@sharedrecruiting.co).
